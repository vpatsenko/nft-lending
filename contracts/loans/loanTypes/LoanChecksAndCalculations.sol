     * - First, it prevents replay attacks where an attacker would submit a user's off-chain order more than once.
     * - Second, it allows a user to cancel an off-chain order by calling NFTfi.cancelLoanCommitment()
     , which marks the nonce as used and prevents any future loan from using the user's off-chain order that contains
     * that nonce.
